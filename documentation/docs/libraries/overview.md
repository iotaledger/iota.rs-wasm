# IOTA Client libraries

There are currently available the following official bindings to `iota.rs`:

- [Rust](../getting_started/rust.mdx) 
- [Node.js](../getting_started/nodejs.mdx) 
- [Python](../getting_started/python.mdx) 
- [Java](../getting_started/java.mdx) 

## Getting Started

It is a recommended approach to start your interactions with IOTA on a `testnet` network. API load balancer: https://api.testnet.shimmer.network

Network explorer is available at [IOTA Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet).

In order to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens! You can get some testnet tokens using the [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network). However, we strongly recommend to leverage official [wallet.rs](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/wallet.rs/welcome) library in case of value-based IOTA transfers.
