# Getting Started with Java

## Security

<WarningPasswordStorage/>

## Requirements

* The latest [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to compile the binding.
* (for Linux only) `libudev`. You can install it with `apt install libudev-dev`.
* pkg-config is needed (for Linux `apt install pkg-config`)

## Build the JAR for Your Operating System (Linux, macOS, Windows)

To use the IOTA Java Client Library in your Java project, you must first build the library JAR for your operating
system.

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the [iota.rs client library](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs) by running the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iotaledger/iota.rs.git
```

### Change to the Java Binding Directory

After you have cloned the repository, you should change directory to `iota.rs/bindings/java/iota-client-java`. You can do so by
running the following command:

```bash
cd iota.rs/bindings/java/iota-client-java
```

### Make `gradlew` Executable

If needed, you can make the `gradlew` file executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x gradlew
```

### Build Your JAR

You can now build your JAR file by running the following command:

```bash
./gradlew jar
```

This will produce a `JAR` file in `build/libs/` which you can add to your Java project.

## Use the Library

After you linked the library, you can create a Client instance and interface with it as shown in the following snippet:

```java
import org.iota.Client;
import org.iota.types.ClientConfig;
import org.iota.types.ClientException;
import org.iota.types.responses.NodeInfoResponse;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ClientException {
        // Build the client.
        Client client = new Client(new ClientConfig().withNodes(new String[]{"https://api.testnet.shimmer.network"}));

        // Get the node information for a given node.
        NodeInfoResponse response = client.getNodeInfo();

        // Print the URL of the node that was requested.
        System.out.println(response.getNodeUrl());

        // Print the node information for the requested node.
        System.out.println(response.getNodeInfo());
    }
}
```

## Keep Learning

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/00_run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code example project ](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/bindings/java/iota-client-java/examples/ExampleProject/src).
